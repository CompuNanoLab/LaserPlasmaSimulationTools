# Laser Plasma Simulation Tools
Instructions and examples for running Particle-In-Cell (PIC), radiative hydrodynamics, and Monte Carlo codes to study laser-plasma interaction on laptops and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems.

Structure of the repository:
- **PIC_tools** contains instructions and scripts for PIC simulations.
- **RH_tools** contains instructions and scripts for radiative hydrodynamic simulations.
- **MC_tools** contains instructions and scripts for Monte Carlo simulations.

This repository is maintained by the [laser-plasma team](https://www.ensure.polimi.it/) of NanoLab at Politecnico di Milano.
